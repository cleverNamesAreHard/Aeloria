# Elarion Tactical RPG
### A D&D Campaign Conversion Effort

This is a personal project to adapt a custom Dungeons & Dragons campaign into a turn-based tactical RPG.  The goal is to make the story and world accessible outside the tabletop setting, giving players a way to experience the campaign solo.

#### Note
As of now, it's just colors on the grid.  There are no assets yet.  GIFs of gameplay coming soon.

## Project Goals

- Build a tactical RPG in the style of Final Fantasy Tactics  
- Use a grid-based movement and combat system  
- Let players control a party through missions tied to a larger narrative  
- Capture the tone and pacing of a D&D campaign in a playable format  

## Currently Implemented

- Turn-based combat with initiative order and grid movement  
- Character stats (STR/DEX/CON/etc) and equipment that affect gameplay  
- A working UI for move, attack, item, and end turn actions  
- Skills with different categories (attack, magic, support)  
- Enemies with basic AI that take actions based on range and logic  
- A battle log system that logs rolls, effects, and outcomes
