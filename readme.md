# Tactical RPG – D&D Campaign Conversion

This is a personal project to convert a custom Dungeons & Dragons campaign into a tactical RPG. The goal is to make the world and story more accessible outside of traditional tabletop sessions, and to give players a way to experience the campaign on their own.

## Project Goals

- Build a turn-based tactical RPG similar to Final Fantasy Tactics
- Use a grid-based movement and combat system
- Allow players to control a party of characters through missions tied to a larger narrative
- Capture the tone and structure of a tabletop D&D campaign in a playable game format

---

## What the Game Will Include

- A party system with allies and enemies taking turns
- Grid-based maps where movement and positioning matter
- A branching story with scripted missions and narrative progression
- Character stats, leveling, and abilities (based on D&D mechanics)
- Encounters adapted directly from sessions in the original campaign

## Why This Exists

This is meant to be a playable version of a homebrew campaign setting, so others can experience it without needing to be at the table. It also makes it easier to revisit the story or try out different decisions without relying on memory or group availability.

## Current Status

Right now, the project includes a working prototype with basic movement, turn order, and team setup. The goal is to continue expanding it gradually — first by adding stats, then attacks, and eventually a full story progression system.

This is a work in progress.
